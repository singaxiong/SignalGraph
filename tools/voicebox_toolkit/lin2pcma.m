function p=lin2pcma(x,m,s)
%LIN2PCMA Convert linear PCM to A-law P=(X,M,S)
%	pcma = lin2pcma(lin) where lin contains a vector
%	or matrix of signal values.
%	The input values will be converted to integer
%	A-law pcm vlues in the range 0 to 255 and the XORed with m
%	(default m=85).
%	
%	Input values are multiplied by the scale factor s:
%
%		   s		Input Range
%
%		   1		+-4096
%		2017.396342	+-2.03033976 (default)
%		4096		+-1
%
%	Input values outside the selected range will be clipped.
%
%	The default value of the scale factor is 2017.396342 which equals
%	sqrt((1120^2 + 2624^2)/2). This factor follows ITU standard G.711 and
%	the sine wave with PCM-A values [225 244 244 225 97 116 116 97]
%	has a mean square value of unity corresponding to 0 dBm0.
