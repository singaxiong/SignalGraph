function [cc,c0]=lpcar2cc(ar,np)
%LPCAR2CC LPC: Convert AR filter to complex cepstrum [CC,C0]=(AR,NP)
%
%  Inputs: ar(nf,n+1)   AR coefficients, one frame per row
%          np           Number of cepstral coefficients to calculate [n]
%
% Outputs: cc(nf,np)    Complex cepstral coefficients, excluding c(0)
%          c0(nf,1)     Coefficient c(0)
%
% The "complex cepstral coefficients", cc(n), are the inverse discrete-time Fourier transform
% of the log of the complex-valued spectrum. The cc(n) are real-valued and, for n<0, cc(n)=0.
% The "real cepstral coeffcients", rc(n), are the inverse discrete-time Fourier transform
% of the log of the magnitude spectrum; rc(0)=cc(0) and rc(n)=0.5*cc(n) for n~=0.
