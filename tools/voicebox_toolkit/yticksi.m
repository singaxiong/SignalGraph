function s=yticksi(ah)
%YTIXKSI labels the y-axis of a plot using SI multipliers S=(AH)
%
%  Inputs:  AH       axis handle [default: current axes]
%
% Outputs:  S        optional global SI multiplier (see usage below)
%
% Usage:   (1) plot(...);
%              yticksi;
%
%          (2) plot(...);
%              ylabel(['Frequency (' yticksi 'Hz)']);
%
% The first form will label the tick marks on the y-axis of the current plot
% using SI multipliers where appropriate. This is particularly useful for log
% plots which MATLAB does not label very well.
% The second form will, if possible, use a single SI multiplier for all the tick
% marks; this global multiplier can be incorporated into the axis label as shown.
