function [p,s]=permutes(n)
%PERMUTES All N! permutations of 1:N + signatures [P,S]=(N)
% The output P is a matrix of size (N!,N) where each row
% contains a permutation of the numbers 1:N. The rows are in 
% lexically sorted order.
%
% To permute the elements of an arbitrary vector V use
% V(PERMUTES(LENGTH(V))).

% PERMUTES(N) is the same as SORTROWS(PERMS(1:N)) but much faster.

% Thanks to Peter J Acklam for several improvements.
