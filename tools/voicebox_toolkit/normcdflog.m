function p=normcdflog(x,m,s)
%NORMCDFLOG calculates log of Normal Cumulative Distribution function p=(x,m,s)
%
% Inputs: 
%
%     X        Input data (vector or matrix)
%     M        Mean of Normal distribution [default 0]
%     S        Std deviation of Normal distribution [default 1]
%
% Outputs: 
%
%     P        P = log(normcdf(X)); same size as X
%
% The routine gives accurate values even if X is large and negative
