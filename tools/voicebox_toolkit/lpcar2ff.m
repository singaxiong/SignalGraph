function [ff,f]=lpcar2ff(ar,np)
%LPCAR2FF LPC: Convert AR coefs to complex spectrum FF=(AR,NP)
%
%  Inputs: ar(nf,n)     AR coefficients, one frame per row
%          np           Size of output spectrum is np+1 [n]
%
% Outputs: ff(nf,np+1)  Complex spectrum from DC to Nyquist
%          f(1,np+1)    Normalized frequencies (0 to 0.5)
%
% For high speed make np equal to a power of 2
