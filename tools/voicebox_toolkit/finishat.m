function [eta,etaf]=finishat(frac,tol,fmt)
%FINISHAT print estimated finish time of a long computation (FRAC,TOL,FMT)
% Usage: (1)  finishat(0);
%              for i=1:many
%                  ... computation ...
%                  finishat(i/many);
%              end
%
%         (2)  finishat(0);
%              for i=1:NI
%                  for j=1:NJ
%                      for k=1:NK
%                          ... computation ...
%                          finishat((((i-1)*NJ+j-1)*NK+k)/(NI*NJ*NK));
%                      end
%                  end
%              end
%          
% Inputs: FRAC = fraction of total comutation that has been completed
%                As a special case, 0 is used to initialize the routine
%         TOL  = Tolerance in minutes. If the estimated time has changed by less
%                than this, then nothing will be printed. [default 10% of remaining time]
%         FMT  = Format string which should include %s for estimated finish time, %d for remaining minutes and %f for fraction complete
%
% Output: ETA  = string containing the expected finish time
%                specifying this will suppress printing message to std err (fid=2)
%         ETAF = expected finish time as a daynumber
%
% Example:       finishat(0);
%                for i=1:many
%                    long computation;
%                    finishat(i/many);
%                end
