function rr=lpcar2rr(ar,p)
%LPCAR2RR Convert autoregressive coefficients to autocorrelation coefficients RR=(AR,P)
% The routine calculated the autocorrelation coefficients of the signal
% that results from feeding unit-variance, zero-mean noise into the all-pole filter
% Input:   ar(:,n+1)  Autoregressive coefficients including 0'th coefficient
% Output:  rr(:,p+1)    Autocorrelation coefficients including 0'th order coefficient
% If p is not specified it is taken to be n
