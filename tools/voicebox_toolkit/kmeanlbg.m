%KMEANLBG Vector quantisation using the Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm [X,ESQ,J]=(D,K)
%
%Inputs:
% D contains data vectors (one per row)
% K is number of centres required
%
%Outputs:
% X is output row vectors (K rows)
% ESQ is mean square error
% J indicates which centre each data vector belongs to
%
%  Implements LBG K-means algorithm:
