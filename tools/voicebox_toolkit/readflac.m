function [y,fs]=readflac(filename,mode)
%READWAV  Read a .FLAC format sound file [Y,FS]=(FILENAME,MODE)
%
% Input Parameters:
%
%	FILENAME gives the name of the file (with optional .WAV extension) or alternatively
%                 can be the FIDX output from a previous call to READWAV
%	MODE		specifies the following (*=default):
%
%    Scaling: 's'    Auto scale to make data peak = +-1
%             'r'    Raw unscaled data (integer values)
%             'q'    Scaled to make 0dBm0 be unity mean square
%             'p' *	 Scaled to make +-1 equal full scale
%             'o'    Scale to bin centre rather than bin edge (e.g. 127 rather than 127.5 for 8 bit values)
%                     (can be combined with n+p,r,s modes)
%             'n'    Scale to negative peak rather than positive peak (e.g. 128.5 rather than 127.5 for 8 bit values)
%                     (can be combined with o+p,r,s modes)
