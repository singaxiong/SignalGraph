# Introduction
Each node in the computational graph is called a node or layer. There are input nodes, output nodes, cost function nodes, etc. 
Each node need to have two functions, i.e. the forward pass and backward pass (back-propagation). Some nodes, such as short time fourier transform, only have forward pass function because we don't need the backward pass now. 
This folder contains all the forward (F_xxx) and backward (B_xxx) functions of the nodes, and also some supporting functions. 

#List of nodes
* Input nodes
  - Input: no function associated. Allow the network to input  
  - Weight to activation: curr_layer = F_weight2activation(curr_layer). This is a specially designed node type. It's activation is the same as its weight. This node is used when we want to have the weights as inputs.
